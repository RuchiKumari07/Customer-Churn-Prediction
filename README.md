# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation to identify patterns that predict customer churn.

## 📁 File Structure

- `churn data.ipynb` – The main notebook containing:
  - Data loading and cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Final predictions and insights

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding environment

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer data with features such as:

- Customer demographics (gender, age, etc.)
- Account information (tenure, charges, etc.)
- Services subscribed
- Churn status (target variable)

> Note: Ensure your dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the path accordingly.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
